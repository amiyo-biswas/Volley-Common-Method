# Volley_Common_Class

Volley excels at RPC-type operations used to populate a UI, such as fetching a page of search results as structured data. It integrates easily with any protocol and comes out of the box with support for raw strings, images, and JSON. By providing built-in support for the features you need, Volley frees you from writing boilerplate code and allows you to concentrate on the logic that is specific to your app.
